As a newly emerging civil society actor in the Trougout region, the association held its inaugural event on 20/05/2025 under the slogan 'From Trougout to the Future,' in partnership with the school's administration. The seminar program included student reception, speeches by the Association President, the School Principal, and the School Life Coordinator, introduction of guests, and guest presentations: Mohamed Afkir – National School of Applied Sciences in Al Hoceima / Data Engineering, Abubakar Bourbain – Multidisciplinary Faculty in Nador / Public Law Department, Mohamed Baouch – Faculty of Sciences and Technologies in Al Hoceima / PhD in Environmental Chemistry and Water Treatment, and Professor Moussa Afrmas – Insights into Sociology and Philosophy after the Baccalaureate. Additional activities included a cultural competition workshop, a motivation and stress management session, a 'Share your Baccalaureate experience' workshop with school teachers, and closing remarks by Association President Jamal Baqdour. The seminar created a vibrant educational atmosphere and strong interaction among participants — students, teachers, and facilitators — inspiring the association's leadership to continue its mission with renewed energy, aiming to strengthen civic engagement and youth empowerment in the region.",
